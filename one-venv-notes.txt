* Debian needs `apt install python3-venv

REMAINING ISSUES:

* [SOLVED] pygame zero mode not available as the logic tries to import pgzero to determine
  available modes, but it's not available yet because of the venv
* [SOLVED] Debugger not working -- @ntoll on the case -- apparently the path to the
  filename from the view tab -- in panes.py:start_process around line 800,
  where the debugger is started, need to add mu_dir as PYTHONPATH
* [SOLVED] Should we pip install --upgrade after creating the venv? (What about users
  without internet access)
* Distinguish user-installed from mode-installed packages -- when creating the venv do an 
  immediate pip freeze and store in the settings file. Then, when generating list of installed
  packages, tag the mode-installed ones as "INSTALLED BY MU" or similar
* REPL doesn't work -- some kind of asyncio issue:

LATER:

* Move the venv creation inside the UI (ie have a "Mu is installing..." box)
* Move "run process" logic inside the VirtualEnvironment class
* Have Qt signals/slots inside the VirtualEnvironment class as well
