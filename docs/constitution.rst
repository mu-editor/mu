Mu's Constitution
=================

Our Values
----------

Happily, Mu's users and developers are a diverse and international community
with a reputation as a friendly, welcoming and dynamic group.

We trust that such collaborators will treat each other in a way that reflects
the widely held view that diversity and friendliness are strengths of our
community to be celebrated and fostered.

We believe everyone involved in Mu's community has a right to:

* be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;
* be free from any form of discrimination, victimisation, harassment or
  bullying;
* enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behaviour, inappropriate language
  and unsuitable imagery.

To this end, we ask and hope participants in our community will abide by the
spirit of our :doc:`code_of_conduct`.

The Role of Administrators
--------------------------

Administrators are volunteers who serve the Mu project. They demonstrate and
are expected to be the embodiment of our values described above.

Because of such service and trust in their behaviour, they have the privileges
needed to run the infrastructure relating to Mu.

Administrators have privileges in three areas:

1. The development of Mu (by virtue of their sustained and significant
   technical contributions),
2. The infrastructure that supports the development of Mu (technical services
   hosted by third parties),
3. The official channels for community discussion and participation 
   (communication services hosted by third parties).

Anything not covered by these three areas is outside the ability of the
administrators to effectively monitor and supervise.

* Admin processes for: dev, infrastructure, communication channels.
* Who are currently administrators
* Becoming an admin
* Removal of an admin

Contributing to Mu
------------------

We're delighted for people to report problems, make suggestions and contribute
code. Indeed we encourage it. We'd ask you to follow our development guidelines
and, of course, to be respectful of our time.

It may be that we decide not to adopt some change you've proposed -- or even
coded. Please don't take this personally. Any project, especially one with many
users, has to measure contributions against its design ideals. And sometimes
the two don't match.

Managing Expectations
---------------------

We recognise that Mu is a useful educational tool for individual learners and
also in classrooms and coding club situations. And we're delighted that the
tool we've built helps both beginner programmers and educators as much as it
does.

However, Mu is no-one's full-time job. No-one earns money from developing Mu
and all of us involved offer our time freely as a benefit to the educational
coding community and those taking thier first steps in programming. The amount
of time we can dedicate to Mu is constrained by Real Life.

Typically you'll see some development work on Mu every week or so, and official
releases every few months. You can always download the nightly builds or simply
run from source: our master branch is always tested with 100% coverage so even
the current development version is fairly stable.

When Something is Amiss
-----------------------

Problems, mistakes and misunderstandings occur within any community. We hope,
if at all possible, that folks try to work out such situations with compassion,
patience and forgiveness. However, situations may arise that cannot be resolved
without the intervention of Mu's administrators.

In this case please contact the administrators via email: <email TBC>

Any contact will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated, and
dealt with sensitively. Mu admins reserve the right to carry out any of the
following actions concerning community related problems:

* Persons concerned may be asked to stop/modify their behaviour.
* Persons may be warned that enforcement action may be taken if such behaviour
  continues.
* Persons may be blocked from further participation in the Mu project via the
  communication channels controlled by Mu administrators.
* If appropriate or required by law, a problem may be reported to the Police or
  other suitable authority.

On Sensitive Issues
-------------------

Mu, by virtue of the fact that it caters to beginner developers and those
working in an educational environment, will be used by children.

* Child protection
* When folks use Mu for anti-social reasons (e.g. bullying)
* Mental health

Changing the Constitution
-------------------------

This is a dynamic document and should reflect the evolution of Mu's community.
Therefore, we hope the following clear steps help the community to engage and
take ownership of this process.
