* Main entry point -> app.py:run
  either via -m or via run.py or via the installed launcher
* Steps:
    - set up logging
    - create QApplication
    - create core Window (ultimately from interface\main.py:Window)
    - use a closure to add a callback for the Window's load_theme [not clear why]
    - create a logical editor (from logic.py:Editor) passing the core Window as its "view"
    - set up the editor (via logic.py\Editor:setup), secondarily setting up modes (via app.py:setup_modes)
    - throw in various connectors to the editor window
    - throw up a splash screen for 2 secs
    - run the app
* Logical editor setup (in logic.py:__init__ & setup)
    - Reset the theme, the mode, the list of modes, the microbit runtime, list of
      connected devices,
