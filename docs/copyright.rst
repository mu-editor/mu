    Hello Nicholas, 

    Thank you very much for asking and for your kind words. 
    As long as there is no commercial use of the image, and since you
    mention my project, it is absolutely fine!
    I am very happy the images help to prove a point!

    Many greetings from Athens, Greece,

    Go for it! Feel free to do whatever weird(and not weird) things you
    like with it.

    It's a modification (by me) of a logo by Gareth Noyce, who also put
    the logo files in public domain.

    Gareth Noyce said of the logo files:
    They're public domain but I'd like attribution if they're used
    anywhere.  Just a "logo by Gareth Noyce" would do, but I won't be
    complaining if people forget. :)'

This is a copy of the Python logo owned by the
`Python Software Foundation <https://python.org/psf>`_
(PSF). Mu was originally written by a PSF Fellow on behalf of the PSF as part
of the PSF's contribution to the BBC's micro:bit project. Furthermore, the PSF
say of the `use of the Python logo <https://www.python.org/community/logos/>`_):

    "Projects and companies that use Python are encouraged to incorporate
    the Python logo on their websites, brochures, packaging, and elsewhere
    to indicate suitability for use with Python or implementation in
    Python. Use of the "two snakes" logo element alone, without the
    accompanying wordmark is permitted on the same terms as the combined
    logo.

    In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to
    indicate use of Python or suitability for Python."
