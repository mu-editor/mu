Contributing to Mu
------------------

Hey! Many thanks for wanting to improve Mu.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
age, gender, religion, race or sexuality. If you're thinking, "but they don't
mean me", *then we especially mean YOU*. Good quality code and engagement
with respect, humour and intelligence wins every time.

* If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most geeky
  groups, get involved - *we want to help you make a difference*.
* If you're from a background which *is* well-represented in most geeky
  groups, get involved - *we want your help making a difference*.
* If you're worried about not being technical enough, get involved - *your
  fresh perspective will be invaluable*.
* If you think you're an imposter, get involved.
* If your day job isn't code, get involved.
* This isn't a group of experts, just people. Get involved!
* We are interested in educational, social and technical problems. If you are
  too, get involved.
* This is a new community. *No-one knows what they are doing*, so, get involved.

We expect contributors to follow the Python Software Foundation's Code of
Conduct: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

Feedback may be given for contributions and, where necessary, changes will
be politely requested and discussed with the originating author. Respectful
yet robust argument is most welcome.

Finally, contributions are subject to the following caveat: the contribution
was created by the contributor who, by submitting the contribution, is
confirming that they have the authority to submit the contribution and place it
under the license as defined in the LICENSE file found within this repository.

Checklist
+++++++++

* Your code should be commented in *plain English* (British spelling).
* If your contribution is for a major block of work and you've not done so
  already, add yourself to the AUTHORS file following the convention found
  therein.
* We have 100% test coverage - include tests to maintain this!
* **Before submitting code ensure coding standards and test coverage by running**::

    $ make check

* If in doubt, ask a question. The only stupid question is the one that's never asked.
* Most importantly, **Have fun!**
