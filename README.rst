Mu - A Simple Python Code Editor 
================================

.. image:: https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/logo.png

Mu is a simple code editor for beginner programmers based on extensive feedback
from teachers and learners. Having said that, Mu is for anyone who wants to use
a simple "no frills" editor.

Mu is a modal editor with modes for Adafruit's CircuitPython, the micro:bit's
version of MicroPython, PyGame Zero and standard Python 3 (including a
graphical debugger). Some of the modes make available a REPL (either
running on the connected CircuitPython or MicroPython device or as a Jupyter
based iPython session in Python3 mode).

Mu is written in Python and works on Windows, macOS, Linux and Raspberry Pi. The
project's public facing website is
`https://codewith.mu/ <https://codewith.mu/>`_. We celebrate the work done by
users of mu at `https://madewith.mu/ <https://madewith.mu/>`_.

We have `extensive developer documentation <https://mu.readthedocs.io/>`_
including a guide for
`setting up a development environment <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>`_,
