It supports both 8-bit and Unicode strings; both\nthe pattern and the strings being processed can contain null bytes and\ncharacters outside the US ASCII range.\n\nRegular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.\nMost ordinary characters, like \"A\", \"a\", or \"0\", are the simplest\nregular expressions; they simply match themselves.  You can\nconcatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.\n\nThe special characters are:\n    \".\"      Matches any character except a newline.\n    \"^\"      Matches the start of the string.\n    \"$\"      Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at\n             the end of the string.\n    \"*\"      Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.\n             Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.\n    \"+\"      Matches 1 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.\n    \"?\"      Matches 0 or 1 (greedy) of the preceding RE.\n    *?,+?,?? Non-greedy versions of the previous three special characters.\n    {m,n}    Matches from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE.\n    {m,n}?   Non-greedy version of the above.\n    \"\\\\\"     Either escapes special characters or signals a special sequence.\n    []       Indicates a set of characters.\n             A \"^\" as the first character indicates a complementing set.\n    \"|\"      A|B, creates an RE that will match either A or B.\n    (...)    Matches the RE inside the parentheses.\n             The contents can be retrieved or matched later in the string.\n    (?aiLmsux) The letters set the corresponding flags defined below.\n    (?:...)  Non-grouping version of regular parentheses.\n    (?P<name>...) The substring matched by the group is accessible by name.\n    (?P=name)     Matches the text matched earlier by the group named name.\n    (?#...)  A comment; ignored.\n    (?=...)  Matches if ... matches next, but doesn't consume the string.\n    (?!...)  Matches if ... doesn't match next.\n    (?<=...) Matches if preceded by ... (must be fixed length).\n    (?<!...) Matches if not preceded by ... (must be fixed length).\n    (?(id/name)yes|no) Matches yes pattern if the group with id/name matched,\n                       the (optional) no pattern otherwise.\n\nThe special sequences consist of \"\\\\\" and a character from the list\nbelow.

The interesting\nproperty of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.\n\nUsage:\n\nheap = []            # creates an empty heap\nheappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap\nitem = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap\nitem = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it\nheapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time\nitem = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds\n                               # new item; the heap size is unchanged\n\nOur API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:\n\n- We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the\n  index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less\n  obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.\n\n- Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.\n\nThese two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list\nwithout surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()\nmaintains the heap invariant!"
