Code of Conduct
---------------

We expect contributors to follow the
`Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_,
reproduced below.

The Python community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse
set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences
that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When
you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these
guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep Python a
positive, successful, and growing community.

A member of the Python community is:

Open
++++

Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs,
patches, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comment and
criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the
whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our
activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone
can make a difference.

Considerate
+++++++++++

Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users.
We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that
often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're
attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful
when approaching differing views.

Respectful
++++++++++

Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their
positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful
of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're respectful
of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we
disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.

Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because
we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will
come naturally.
