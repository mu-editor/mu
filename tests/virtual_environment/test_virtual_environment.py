"""
Tests for the virtual_environment module supporting Mu's runtime venv

Creating a virtual environment involves a certain amount of disk
activity and is fairly expensive in testing terms; pip-installing
things even more so, even when they're only wheels from local disk

The trick is not to test that *venv* itself works, or pip, both of which
we assume. Rather we have to test whether our use of those tools give
the effect we want.

So a lot of the time we're going to be mocking things like subprocess.run
and checking that appropriate things are called. We need to be careful
not to over-describe the parameters as we might, for example, want later
to add or remove certain flags, or to use different wheels.
