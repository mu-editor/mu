## Package MU

From the project root directory, run:

```
pyinstaller package/pyinstaller.spec
```

The single file executable should be saved in `/dist/mu` or `/dist/mu.exe`.

The spec file `package/pyinstaller.spec` can be edited to simplify packaging debugging.


## Run the executable

On Windows you can simply double-click the `mu.exe` file.

On Linux or OS X, ensure the file permissions are set to executable and, from the file location, run:

```
./mu
```
