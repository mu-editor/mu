        This is intended to be used, eg, when a command-line switch overrides

        But it could be used to implement a cascade of settings, eg for an
        admin to set site-wide settings followed by user settings. This might
        be implemented by, eg, command-line switches specifying more than one
        settings file. If this happens, the last file named becomes the settings's
        filepath -- meaning that's where the settings will be saved at the end
        of the session.

        This operates in a similar way to configparser: if a file isn't found
        the function silently succeeds. However the filepath is still stored.
        This has the effect that, eg, loading a site-wide admin file first
        followed by a user-specific file will load the admin settings, but will
        save to the user-specific file.
