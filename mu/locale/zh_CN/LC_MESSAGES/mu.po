"corresponding to the red, green, and blue components of the color. These\n"
"values take a value from 0.0 to 1.0 (least to full intensity). The class\n"
"provides several attributes which can be used to convert one color system\n"

"    (0.0, 0.5, 1.0)\n"

"    (0.114, 0.435912, -0.099978)\n"
"\n"
"As :class:`Color` derives from tuple, instances are immutable. While this\n"
"provides the advantage that they can be used as keys in a dict, it does\n"
"mean that colors themselves cannot be directly manipulated (e.g. by\n"
"reducing the red component).\n"
"\n"
"However, several auxilliary classes in the module provide the ability to\n"
"perform simple transformations of colors via operators which produce a new\n"
":class:`Color` instance. For example::\n"
"\n"
"    >>> Color('red') - Red(0.5)\n"
"    <Color \"#7f0000\">\n"
"    >>> Color('green') + Red(0.5)\n"
"    <Color \"#7f8000\">\n"
"    >>> Color.from_hls(0.5, 0.5, 1.0)\n"
"    <Color \"#00feff\">\n"

"    (0.5, 0.4, 1.0)\n"
"\n"
"From the last example above one can see that even attributes not directly\n"
"stored by the color (such as lightness) can be manipulated in this fashion.\n"
"In this case a :class:`Color` instance is constructed from HLS (hue,\n"
"lightness, saturation) values with a lightness of 0.5. This is multiplied\n"
"by a :class:`Lightness` instance with a value of 0.8 which constructs a new\n"
":class:`Color` with the same hue and saturation, but a lightness of 0.5 *\n"
"0.8 = 0.4.\n"
"\n"
"If an instance is converted to a string (with :func:`str`) it will return a\n"
"string containing the 7-character HTML code for the color (e.g. \"#ff0000\"\n"
"for red). As can be seen in the examples above, a similar representation is\n"

"Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information\n"
"needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the\n"
"command line. The keyword arguments to the Action constructor are also\n"
"all attributes of Action instances.\n"
"\n"
"Keyword Arguments:\n"
"\n"
"    - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which\n"
"        should be associated with this action.\n"
"\n"
"    - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)\n"
"\n"
"    - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be\n"
"        consumed. By default, one argument will be consumed and a single\n"
"        value will be produced.  Other values include:\n"
"            - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)\n"
"            - '?' consumes zero or one arguments\n"
"            - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)\n"
"            - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)\n"
"        Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that\n"
"        with the default, a single value will be produced, while with\n"
"        nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.\n"
"\n"
"    - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the\n"
"        option uses an action that takes no values.\n"
"\n"
"    - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.\n"
"\n"
"    - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and\n"
"        returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,\n"
"        float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,\n"
"        str is used.\n"
"\n"
"    - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,\n"
"        after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate\n"
"        type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this\n"
"        collection.\n"
"\n"
"    - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the\n"
"        command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line\n"
"        arguments.\n"
"\n"
"    - help -- The help string describing the argument.\n"
"\n"
"    - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the\n"
"        help string. If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name."
