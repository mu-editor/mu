Release History
---------------

1.1.0-beta.7
============

This is a beta release and may contain bugs or unfinished features. Please
provide bug reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* We expect this release to be the last beta before the final 1.1 release in
  the new year of 2022. Season's greetings to everyone using or contributing to
  Mu, and here's wishing you all a flourishing and fulfilling 2022.
* As always there have been the usual minor bug fixes and clean ups from the
  core team of maintainers. Thank you so much for all that you do to support
  the continued development of Mu.
* Thanks to the ever-green @keith-packard for his contribution to ensure icons
  on the button bar continuously scale based on the window width. This looks
  really smooth and slick.
* Tinsel laden @tmontes has made a number of contributions around tooling for
  internationalization (i18n) of Mu. These include using the
  `Babel <http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/>`_
  package for generating the required translation files from our source code,
  and updating the ``Makefile`` (and ``make.py``) so the process can be automated.
* Xmassy @xbecas is a new joiner to the core team and we're very please to have
  him with us since he has done a **huge** amount of work on updating and
  curating the translation files needed for i18n. Thanks to his work,
  translators for all the other existing locales need not have to go through
  the string generation/update steps (he's done that for you already!).
* Both @xbecas and @tmontes have made extensive updates to our pt-PT
  (Portuguese) translation. Feliz Natal e Próspero Ano Novo.
* This was swiftly followed by a welcome contribution by @rffontenelle the
  red-nosed translator, who made extensive updates to the pt-BR
  (Brazilian Portuguese) translation. Many thanks Rafael, you continue to
  demonstrate why the Brazilian FLOSS community is such a vibrant place, and
  we hope your work will help beginner coders in Brazil take their first steps
  to join your community. Boas Festas!
* Now that the upstream PyGame / PyGameZero packages have been updated and
  repackaged, @tmontes has ensured we use these (rather than our own custom
  builds) in our installers for Windows and OSX. Many thanks to our friends and
  collaborators in those projects (cc/ @illume and @lordmauve).
* Once in royal @devdanzin's repos, stood some lowly bugs to fix. These include
  ensuring empty path handling is properly handled by ``get_save_path``, correct
  highlighting of both f-strings and triple quoted strings in the editor
  widget, fixing a comment-toggling bug that deleted the first character of the
  next line under certain circumstances and more robust handling of environment
  variables. Wow, @devdanzin was on fire..! (...and has further work in
  development, thank you so much for your continued contributions.)
* Carolling @carlosperate has put a huge effort in. He has triaged various
  crash reports, administered our continuous integration pipeline, and reviewed
  and merged much of the work described above. He also ensured our version
  numbering for Mu is no longer odd, and meets the guidelines set out in
  `PEP440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/>`_.
* Good Tim Golden (@tjguk) fast typed out, a venv that's crisp and even. His
  outstanding work on making Python virtual environments work in some of the
  most inhospitable computing environments ever found is miraculous. Tim's
  genius is to know exactly the right intervention to make, and in this case
  his epic addition of ``-I`` to the Mu codebase will help ensure the user's
  virtual environments are properly isolated.
* @tiago has updated the `pup <https://github.com/mu-editor/pup>`_ packager we
  use to create our installer. This should fix a problem found on the new
  ARM based Macs. He has also made significant progress on a cross-distro Linux
  package which we hope will make an appearance in the not-too-distant future.
* Finally, Nicholas (@ntoll) promises never to do another Christmas themed
  changelog.

1.1.0-beta.6
============

This is a beta release and may contain bugs or unfinished features. Please
provide bug reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* Another delayed release due to busy-ness of the volunteer team involved in
  Mu. Thank you for your patience, bug reports and code patches.
* There have been the usual minor bug fixes and clean ups from various regular
  contributors and some new ones too. Thank you for your careful and well
  targetted changes.
* Carlos (@carlosperate) fixed some packaging problems relating to the iPython
  kernel bundled with Mu.
* Martin (@dybber) fixed a couple of problems relating to the stopping of
  child processes (Flask and scripts stopped via KeyboardInterrupt in Linux).
* The web mode checks for the availability of templates in the local directory
  tree before starting up. If a template directory isn't found in the expected
  location, then the user sees a helpful message describing the problem and
  what they need to do to fix it.
* Mu's splash screen no longer always appears on top of everything else on the
  user's desktop. The splash screen now also logs the progress of installing
  the various packages needed on first install. Thanks to Carlos for these
  changes.
* A new admin/settings option has been added to allow users to manually change
  the translation Mu uses for its interface. Updating this setting requires a
  restart of Mu. Zander (@ZanderBrown) contributed the icon/glyph to indicate
  the relevant tab is for translation related settings (not entirely obvious
  if Mu's UI is using a language you don't understand and you're looking for
  the setting that relates to translations). The icon makes this clear.
* On some desktop windowing systems there is a bug that means windows re-open
  at a position higher up the screen, and so may appear off the top of the
  screen. We've ensured this never happens with Mu. If Mu starts with any
  part of the window off the screen, the window is moved to be within the
  dimensions of the screen. This was a weird one to track down and fix.
* Many thanks to Ethan Spoelstra (@espoelstra) who contributed a change so
  Crostini on ChromeOS is used to return the correct CIRCUITPY path if it
  exists.
* Huge thanks to Keith Packard (@keith-packard) for several contributions to
  this release of Mu. Keith refactored the way in which Mu handles pasting in
  the REPL window so it works correctly and more broadly across operating
  systems.
* Keith also fixed some font related issues in the REPL.
* Keith was on fire with a couple more contributions relating to SVG icons in
  the buttons in Mu. We're very grateful to Ben Williams (@Rybec) for putting
  in the work to make our button icons SVG files. Keith made the code changes
  to implement this.
* Thanks to Miro Hrončok (@hroncok) for pointing out a change in Python 10
  which would break some of our UI calls into PyQt, and who provided a patch to
  fix things.
* Some minor clarifications in our developer documentation
  (https://mu.rtfd.io).


1.1.0-beta.5
============

This is a beta release and may contain bugs or unfinished features. Please
provide bug reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* We had hoped for a regular (fortnightly) release tempo. Due to the voluntary
  nature of Mu's development and because some of the updates in this release
  were quite challenging (see below), this release is a LOT later than we had
  planned.
* Several of us made minor updates and fixes (such as ensuring various packages
  had explicit dependency versions listed, updating versions for Mu's own
  dependencies and so on).
* Right clicking on highlighted text in the editor, with the REPL active, now
  has an additional option added to the context menu: to correctly paste the
  text from the editor into the REPL. Thanks to Professor Chris Rogers of
  Tufts University for suggesting this feature.
* The multi-talented Dan Halbert of Adafruit very kindly fixed a bug in the
  Adafruit board handling when on run on new Apple M1 hardware. Thank you Dan
  for your valuable contribution.
* A huge amount of work by Tim and Carlos has gone into analysing the crash
  reports from recent beta releases of Mu. This has resulted in significant
  effort to address many of the bugs encountered, many of which related to
  edge cases encountered by the new virtual environment feature. Tim and Carlos
  have created many fixes and checks to ensure these bugs are either completely
  fixed or are, at least, mitigated in more helpful ways. This has been a
  challenging and "fiddly" bit of work, so kudos and thanks, as always, to both
  Tim and Carlos for their continued efforts.
* Carlos has also updated the version of MicroPython used in the BBC micro:bit
  mode to the latest 2.0.0-beta.5 version.
* In addition, Carlos has ensured that the micro:bit mode flashes files onto
  the micro:bit using the correctly memory aligned hex string.
* Github user ajs256 has ensured the crash reporter doesn't kick in when a
  ``KeyboardInterrupt`` is triggered in Mu (CTRL-C).
* Sometimes in Mu for Linux, the expected ``.py`` file extension wasn't added
  to new files. This depended on the user's graphical shell. Mu now checks the
  output from the shell and, if requires, will add ``.py`` itself.
* Various fixes to Mu's logging make it more robust, clear and useful.
* Tiago fixed a late breaking bug in packaging Mu for OSX. All fixed in a
  matter of hours. Amazing work!

There are perhaps a couple more features we want to land in the coming weeks,
and then we will start the work of ensuring internationalization is fully up
to date, the website reflects the new features and various changes, and PUP
will be able to produce redistributable appimages for Linux. Then we will have
reached 1.1.0-final. :-)

1.1.0-beta.4
============

This is a beta release and may contain bugs or unfinished features. Please
provide bug reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* During the beta phase, we're moving to a fortnightly release cadence. Since
  this release is a week late, expect the next one in a week's time - 26th
  April.
* Carlos made many changes to clean up the specification for required modules
  used by the installer. This will make supporting and tracking Mu's
  dependencies MUCH easier. Thank you Carlos!
* Huge thanks to Dan Halbert of Adafruit who contributed a significant amount
  of refactoring to the CircuitPython mode. As a result Mu now uses the
  `adafruit-board-toolkit` module for device identification, among many other
  helpful changes
  [described in Dan's pull request](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/pull/1371).
  Thank you Dan..!
* Carlos was on fire... he also fixed a bug in the file-copy dialog when the
  context menu was opened with an empty list of files.
* Carlos (again), fixed some outstanding documentation issues for supporting
  Raspbian Buster (and newer). These are now at https://mu.rtfd.io/.
* Carlos (again, again) tidied up various aspects of the Makefile so there is
  only a single source of truth for running various utilities and commands.
* Logging was another focus for this release. Now that we have a few weeks
  worth of crash reports we've been able to look at the parts of the
  application that cause most grief and add extra-logging in various locations.
  Tim put in a great effort to make sure the "first run" and other virtual
  environment based aspects of Mu now have clearer and more useful logging and
  throw more useful exceptions, closer to the source of the problem, for the
  resulting crash report. Carlos ensured the IPython kernel installation was
  properly logged.
* We ensured various key packages were pinned to particular versions to
  maximise compatibility with older versions of Python still found in schools.

There are many pull requests and work items currently in flight and they'll be
landing very soon as the overall quality and robustness of Mu significantly
improves. Many thanks to everyone who continues to help, support and contribute
to the ongoing development of Mu.

1.1.0-beta.3
============

This is a beta release and may contain bugs or unfinished features. Please
provide bug reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* During beta phase, we're moving to a fortnightly release cadence. Expect beta
  4 on the 12th April.
* The final version of the Mu splash screen was delivered. Huge thanks to the
  extraordinarily talented Steve Hawkes ([@hawkz](https://github.com/hawkz)) of
  [The Developer Society](https://www.dev.ngo/) for his generous artistic
  support, patience and humorous approach.
* Thanks to a recent update in [PyGame Zero](https://pypi.org/project/pgzero/),
  we're back to using the official package from PyPI, rather than our patched
  fork, in the installer.
* Both Tim and Carlos have contributed updates, fixes and tests to address a
  bug affecting Windows users who may have a space in the file path upon which
  Mu is found. This was a difficult bug to reproduce but Tim did a lot of
  digging to isolate the cause with as much confidence as is possible when it
  comes to such things. Carlos did a bunch of thankless and fiddly test related
  work so testing with spaces in the path is part of our test suite. Work on
  this is ongoing so expect further improvements in upcoming releases. As
  always, many thanks for these efforts.
* Tim addressed a `wheel`/`sdist` related problem that was causing odd side
  effects with regard to dependancies.
* A strange bug, where it was not possible to install third-party packages on
  first run of Mu, opened up a deep rabbit hole of investigation. In the end
  Tim was able to fix this AND address the source of a warning message from Qt
  when Mu was starting for the first time.
* The splash screen code was rewritten in such a way that objects relating to
  the splash screen will always be garbage-collected by Python and destroyed by
  Qt5. Previously, they existed for the full duration of the application, not
  really causing any problems, but "in limbo" nonetheless.
* The crash reporting tool has had a minor update so the user is reminded to
  attach their log file to the bug report, along with an indication of where to
  find the log file.

1.1.0-beta.2
============

This is a beta release and may contain bugs or unfinished features. Please
provide bug reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* This is the first public beta release (beta 1 was created for testing by the
  core development team).
* Many minor bug fixes to the existing new features found in beta 1
  (see below).
* Many thanks to Martin Dybdal for his work on improving the admin panel.
* Carlos made significant changes so Mu can be packaged with very recent
  versions of Python. Carlos also made various changes relating to the status
  of Python packages contained within the official installer.
* Many thanks to Dan Pope for assistance with an upgraded version of PyGameZero
  (which uses the latest version of PyGame - kudos to René and the other
  developers of PyGame for the recent improvements).
* Various fixes to the UI so that panes are easier to resize and the themes are
  correctly applied to the REPL (thanks again to Martin for these fixes).
* Carlos also contributed fixes relating to the micro:bit mode (compatibility
  with versions 1 and 2).
* Tim has made herculean efforts to ensure the creation and checking of Mu's
  virtual environment is robust and easy to maintain.
* A new crash reporting feature has been added. If Mu breaks the user will be
  redirected to the endpoint codewith.mu/crash with details of the crash and an
  option to create a bug report. This ensures Mu crashes are handled more
  gracefully, and the user is able to see the error that caused the crash.
* A new animated splash screen has been added so the initial creation of Mu's
  virtual environment happens in such a way that the user can see progress is
  being made, and updates are logged on the splash screen for the user. If Mu
  encounters a problem at this early stage, the splash screen recovers and the
  new crash reporting feature kicks in. The current animation was created by
  Steve Hawkes (thank you) with a much more polished version promised very
  soon..!
* Behind the scenes, Tiago has continued to make outstanding work on the `pup`
  tool we use to create the installers for Windows 64/32 bit and MacOS X. This
  beta release will be the first to use installers created with `pup`.
* **Known bug** - on first ever start of Mu, if in Python3 mode the package
  manager will not work. Re-starting Mu fixes this (i.e. from second and
  subsequent starts). We're tracking this problem via
  [this issue](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/1358).

1.1.0-beta.1
============

This is a beta release and may contain bugs or unfinished features. Please
provide bug reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* A new mode for ESP8266/ESP32 devices running MicroPython. This work and a
  significant amount of related refactoring was contributed with Viking like
  energy and efficiency by Martin Dybdal. This work has meant it was relatively
  easy to create two further new modes...
* New mode for Lego Spike devices (thanks to Chris and Ethan at Tufts
  University for the help and support).
* New mode for Raspberry Pi Pico (thanks to Zander, Martin and Carlos for the
  extensive testing).
* Updates to the Microbit mode made by Spanish source-code wrangler
  extraordinaire (and resident Microbit expert) Carlos Pereira Atencio. The
  Microbit mode now supports versions 1 and 2 of the board.
* Various bits of artwork used in the application have been updated (including
  a new [temporary] animated splash screen). Thanks to devdanzin for
  choreographing the initial work on the splash screen at short notice.
* A complete re-write of the virtualenv and third party package handlers by the
  hugely talented Tim Golden. This was a long term and difficult refactoring
  project which Tim has delivered with great aplomb. This should make package
  handling much smoother and simpler.
* Various smallish UI fixes, enhancements and smoothing by devdanzin. Thank you
  for these contributions - they really make a difference to the ease of use
  and friendly feel of Mu.
* This version of Mu is packaged with stand-alone installers for Windows and
  OSX by the wonder that is PUP - a new packaging tool by our very own Tiago
  Montes ~ Portugal's Premier Python Packager Par-excellence. We have big plans
  for PUP... watch this space. :-)
* Many many many minor bug fixes contributed by many many many people to whom
  we are eternally grateful.

We hope to release beta.2 very soon.

1.0.3
=====

Bugfix.

* Updated to the latest version of Qt to fix syntax highlighting issues in OSX.
* Ensure CWD is set to the directory containing the script to be run in Python3
  mode.
* Updated website with instructions in light of OSX changes.

1.1.0-alpha.2
=============

The second alpha release of 1.1. This version may contain bugs and is
unfinished (more new features will be arriving in alpha 3). Please provide bug
reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* **NEW FEATURE** A brand new web mode for creating simple dynamic web
  applications with the Flask web framework. Currently users are able to edit
  Python, HTML and CSS files, run a local server and view their website in
  thier browser. We expect to add a deployment option thanks to PythonAnywhere
  by the time alpha 3 is released.
* **NEW FEATURE** A new Slovak translation of Mu thanks to Miroslav Biňas
  (GitHub user `bletvaska <https://github.com/bletvaska>`_).
* **ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED** Fixed a problematic bug where students got into a
  seemingly impossible loop because the auto-save feature encountered errors
  and got in the way of renaming a file. We are THRILLED TO BITS that the fix
  for this problem was contributed by
  `Sean Tibor <http://teachingpython.fm>`_, a teacher from
  Fort Lauderdale, Florida. **Teachers coding the tools they use to teach has
  been a core aim for Mu, and Sean gets the gold medal (or perhaps a beer when
  I next see him) for unlocking this achievement.**
* **RENAME** At the suggestion of Adafruit's Dan Halbert, the "Adafruit" mode
  has been renamed to "CircuitPython" mode to reflect the growing number of
  manufacturers who support CircuitPython. Many thanks to
  `Benjamin Shockley <http://benjaminshockley.com/>`_ for putting the work in
  to make this happen.
* **NEW DEVICES** Several new non-Adafruit boards have been added to the
  renamed CircuitPython mode. Many thanks to
  `Shawn Hymel <http://shawnhymel.com>`_ (SparkFun) and
  `Gustavo Reynaga <http://www.gustavoreynaga.com/>`_ (Electronic Cats) for
  contributing these valuable changes.
* Add some new free-to-reuse image and sound assets for use in PyGameZero
  example games.
* Middle mouse wheel scrolling with the CTRL or CMD (on Mac) keys will zoom the
  UI in a consistent manner across all platforms.
* Minor documentation updates / corrections thanks to
  `Luke Slevinsky <https://lukeslev.github.io/>`_.
* Refinement of the built-in educational libraries as we start to unbundle a
  slew of software from Mu's installer so users can install such packages from
  within Mu. Many thanks to the formidably talented
  `Martin O'Hanlon <https://www.stuffaboutcode.com/>`_ for his help.
* PyGameZero mode will look for game assets relative to the location of the
  game file, rather than just within the user's workspace. Thanks to the
  evergreen `Tim Golden <http://timgolden.me.uk/>`_ for this helpful update.
* Minor corrections to the French localisation by GitHub user
  `ogoletti <https://github.com/ogoletti>`_.
* UI related convenience in the new ESP mode so that the current / most recent
  filesystem path is used when using the file copy pane. Many thanks (as
  always) to `Martin Dybdal <http://dybber.dk/>`_ for his continued work on all
  things ESP related in Mu.
* A tidy up of the file save dialog so it uses Qt's built in dialog features.
  Thanks to `Tiago Montes <https://tmont.es/>`_ for being his usual awesome
  self.
* Tabs are restored on startup in the correct order. Once again, this is the
  work of Tiago Montes.
* The mechanism for generating the various installers and packages for Mu has
  been significantly refactored so that there is, if possible, always a single
  source for configuration information. The significant amount of effort to
  make this happen was, once again (again), contributed by Tiago Montes.
* Window size and location is also restored on startup. Tiago Montes, who
  implemented this change, has been **ON FIRE** during this development phase.
* A small (but important) change to the tool-tip for the sleep function found
  in MicroPython on the micro:bit has been submitted to the pedagogical legend
  and friend of Mu that is `Dave Ames <https://dave-ames.net/>`_.
* A helpful message is now sent to the output pane when the graphical
  debugger starts in Python 3 mode. The Shakespeare like talents of
  long term Mu-tineer `Steve Stagg <https://sta.gg/>`_  are behind this
  Nobel-prize-worthy literary contribution.
* Re-add support for user defined syntax check overrides. Many thanks to
  `Leroy Levin <https://github.com/leroyle>`_ for making this happen..!
* Ensure that ``pip`` is updated while creating the Windows installers. Thanks
  to `Yu Wang <https://github.com/bigeyex>`_ for making this change.
* Various minor updates and fixes to aid code readibility.

1.1.0-alpha.1
=============

The first alpha release of 1.1. This version may contain bugs and is unfinished
(more new features will be added in later alpha releases or, depending on
feedback, we may change the behaviour of existing features). Please provide bug
reports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new

* **NEW FEATURE** Installation of third party packages from PyPI. Click on the
  cog icon to open the admin dialog and select the "Third Party Packages" tab.
* **NEW FEATURE** Code tidy via the wonderful code formatter
  `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Click the new "Tidy"
  button to reformat and tidy your code so it looks more readable. If your code

  maintainer, Łukasz Langa, for this contribution.
* **NEW FEATURE** A new ESP8266 / ESP32 mode for working with these WiFi
  enabled cheap IoT boards. Many thanks to Martin Dybdal for driving this
  work forward and doing the heavy lifting. Thanks also to Murilo Polese for
  testing and very constructive input in the review stage of this feature.
* **OS CHANGE** Due to Qt's and Travis's lack of support, Mu will only run on
  Mac OS 10.12 and above.
* Ensure line-number margin is not too sensitive to inaccurate clicking from
  young coders trying to position the cursor at the beginning of the line.
  Thanks to Tiago Montes for this enhancement.
* Fix some typos in the French translation. Thank you to GitHub user
  @camillem.
* Fix a bug relating to Adafruit boards when a file on a board which is then
  unplugged is saved, Mu used to crash. Thanks to Melissa LeBlanc-Williams for
  the report of this problem.
* Fix problem with a missing newline at the end of a file. Thanks to Melissa
  LeBlanc-Williams for the eagle-eyes and fix.
* Fix for PYTHONPATH related problems on Windows (the current directory is now
  on the path when a script is run). Thanks to Tim Golden for this fix.
* Update to locale detection (use Qt's QLocale class). Thanks to Tiago Montes
  for making this happen.
* Fix bug relating to match selection of non-ASCII characters. Thank you to
  Tiago Montes for this work.
* Fixed various encoding related issues on OSX.
* Various minor / trivial bug fixes and tidy ups.

1.0.2
=====

* Fix encoding bug on Windows which caused crashes and lost files. Many thanks
  to Tim Golden for this work.
* Keyboard focus loss when closing REPL is now fixed. Thanks again Tim Golden.
* More devices for Adafruit mode along with a capability to work with future
  devices which have the Adafruit vendor ID. Thanks to Limor Friend for this
  contribution.
* Fix a bug introduced in 1.0.1 where output from a child Python process was
  being truncated.
* Fix an off-by-one error when reading bytes from UART on MicroPython devices.
* Ensure zoom is consistent and remembered between panes and sessions.
* Ensure mu_code and/or current directory of current script are on Python path
  in Mu installed from the installer on Windows. Thanks to Tim Golden and Tim
  McCurrach for helping to test the fix.
* Added Argon, Boron and Xenon boards to Adafruit mode since they're also
  supported by Adafruit's CircuitPython.
* The directory used to start a load/save dialog is either what the user last
  selected, the current directory of the current file or the mode's working
  directory (in order of precedence). This is reset when the mode is changed.
* Various minor typo and bug fixes.

1.0.1
=====

This is a bugfix and new translation release. No new features were added. The
next release will be 1.1.0 with some new features.

  three arbitrary values) over time these will be plotted as line graphs.
  Many thanks to Limor "ladyada" Fried for contributing code for this feature.
* Major refactoring of how Mu interacts with connected MicroPython based boards
  in order to enable the plotter and REPL to work independently.
* Mu has a new mode for Pygame Zero (version 1.1). Thanks to Dan Pope for
  Pygame Zero and Rene Dudfield for being Pygame maintainer.
